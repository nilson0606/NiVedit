# NiVedit v10.6

A browser-based video editor with English and Traditional Chinese interfaces.

**Open the editor:** https://nilson0606.github.io/NiVedit/

**操作手冊 / User guide（繁體中文）：** [HTML 操作手冊](https://nilson0606.github.io/NiVedit/manual.html)

The guide has 15 chapters with a home index, direct chapter links, search, dark/light modes and print styling.

Use Microsoft Edge on a desktop computer. Import your own videos, images, GIF overlays, audio and subtitles. Media processing happens in your browser; the editor does not upload your media to a server. AI subtitles download their runtime and model files when needed.

## Latest update

The two video tracks and their subtitles are now called top and bottom layers instead of upper and lower tracks, so the names describe what covers what rather than where the row sits. Nothing about stacking or saved projects changed — only the wording.

Timeline rows are also shorter. On a 1366×768 laptop the whole stack — L1 to L5 plus the audio track — fits without scrolling, and the timeline panel sizes itself to its contents until you drag the handle yourself. The scrollbar is still there for projects with many subtitle lanes.

Layer numbers increase downward: bottom video and its subtitles (L1), top video and its subtitles (L2), then images (L3), overlays (L4) and titles (L5).

## Features

- Two video tracks and two subtitle tracks, with independent placement, styling and on-screen position.
- Two-point keyframes for size, position, opacity and rotation.
- Rectangle and circle cropping, including animated crop settings.
- Per-clip transitions, fades and original-audio controls.
- Titles, animated GIF overlays, music tracks and audio volume curves.
- Dark mode by default, with a light-mode toggle.
- Local project saving and video export using browser codecs.

## Build

Python 3 is required only to rebuild the single-file editor:

```sh
python nivedit-src/build.py docs/index.html
```

The checked-in HTML is the verified v10.6 build. GitHub Pages serves the `docs` directory on `main`. After pushing a rebuilt `docs/index.html`, Pages updates automatically.

## Projects and storage

Projects saved in a browser are tied to that website address. To transfer work from the local editor, save a `.nvproj` file there and open it in this website. Keep your own project backups.
